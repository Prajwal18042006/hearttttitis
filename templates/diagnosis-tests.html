          The diagnostic process usually starts with a detailed conversation about your
          symptoms, health history, medications and family history of heart disease. Your
          provider will also perform a physical exam.

            <h3>Blood Tests</h3>
            <p>
              Blood tests can check cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function and markers
              of heart damage. They help identify risk factors and complications.

            <h3>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)</h3>
            <p>
              An ECG records the electrical activity of your heart. It can show heart
              rhythm problems, signs of a previous heart attack or other abnormalities.

            <h3>Echocardiogram</h3>
            <p>
              An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart. It shows how the heart
              chambers and valves move and how well the heart pumps blood.

            <h3>Stress Test</h3>
            <p>
              A stress test looks at how your heart works during physical activity or
              medicine that makes the heart beat faster. It can help detect reduced blood flow.

            <h3>Cardiac Imaging</h3>
            <p>
              Imaging tests such as CT scans, MRI or nuclear scans show detailed pictures of
              the heart and blood vessels to detect blockages or damage.

            <h3>Cardiac Catheterization</h3>
            <p>
              In this procedure, a thin tube is guided through a blood vessel to the heart.
              Dye and X-rays help visualize blockages in the coronary arteries.

        <h2>Preparing for Heart Tests</h2>
        <p>
          Your provider will tell you how to prepare for each test. This may include
          fasting before blood tests, wearing comfortable clothes for exercise tests or
          temporarily changing some medications. Always follow instructions carefully
          and ask questions if anything is unclear.
        </p>
        <p>
          After testing, your provider will discuss the results with you and explain
          what they mean for your care plan.

            <button class="faq-question">Are heart tests painful?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Most tests, such as ECGs, echocardiograms and blood tests, cause little or
                no discomfort. Some procedures, like cardiac catheterization, are more
                invasive but are done with medicine to keep you comfortable.

            <button class="faq-question">Will one test show everything about my heart?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                No single test provides all the information about your heart. Providers
                often combine results from several tests, your symptoms and exam findings
                to make an accurate diagnosis.

            <button class="faq-question">How often should I get my heart checked?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                It depends on your age, medical conditions and risk factors. Many adults
                benefit from routine checkups every year or as advised by their provider.
                People with known heart disease may need more frequent monitoring.
