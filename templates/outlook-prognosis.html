              <p>
                Some causes of heart problems can be corrected, but many types of heart
                disease are long-term conditions. Treatment aims to control symptoms,
                reduce complications and improve quality of life.

                Not necessarily. Many people find that with treatment, rehabilitation and
                lifestyle changes, they can return to many or most of their usual activities.

                It is normal to feel worried or sad. Talking with your healthcare team,
                loved ones, counselors or support groups can help. Focusing on small,
                achievable steps toward better health can also build confidence.
