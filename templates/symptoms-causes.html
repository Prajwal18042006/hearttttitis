          <h2>Common Symptoms of Heart Disease</h2>
          <p>
            Symptoms vary depending on the type of heart disease and may be mild, severe
            or even absent. Always treat new or worsening symptoms seriously, especially
            if they are sudden or intense.
          </p>
          <h3>Possible Symptoms</h3>
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>Chest pain, pressure, tightness or discomfort (angina)</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath with activity or at rest</li>
            <li>Pain, numbness or discomfort in the arms, neck, jaw, back or stomach</li>
            <li>Rapid, pounding, fluttering or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)</li>
            <li>Swelling in the legs, ankles, feet or abdomen</li>
            <li>Unusual tiredness, weakness or fatigue</li>
            <li>Lightheadedness, dizziness or fainting</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="note">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Chest pain or pressure, especially with shortness
            of breath, nausea, sweating or pain spreading to the arm or jaw, may be a sign
            of a heart attack. This is an emergency. Seek immediate medical help.

        <h2>Major Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
        <p class="section-summary">
          Heart disease usually develops because of a combination of factors over time.
          Some can be controlled, while others cannot.

            <h3>Risk Factors You Can Influence</h3>
            <ul class="list-check">
              <li>High blood pressure (hypertension)</li>
              <li>High cholesterol (especially LDL or “bad” cholesterol)</li>
              <li>Smoking or tobacco use</li>
              <li>Diabetes or prediabetes</li>
              <li>Being overweight or living with obesity</li>
              <li>Lack of regular physical activity</li>
              <li>Unhealthy diet (high in salt, sugar and saturated fat)</li>
              <li>Excessive alcohol use</li>
              <li>Long-term stress or poor sleep</li>

            <h3>Risk Factors You Cannot Change</h3>
            <ul class="list-bullet">
              <li>Older age</li>
              <li>Family history of heart disease or early heart attack</li>
              <li>Sex assigned at birth and hormonal changes (for example, after menopause)</li>
              <li>Certain inherited conditions (such as familial high cholesterol)</li>
              <li>Some congenital (from birth) heart problems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Even if you have risk factors you cannot control, improving the ones you
              can change still makes a meaningful difference.

        <h2>How Lifestyle Affects Your Heart</h2>
        <p>
          Everyday choices—such as what you eat, how active you are and whether you smoke—
          can increase or decrease your risk of heart disease. Heart-healthy habits
          support normal blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels.

            <button class="faq-question">Do all people with heart disease have chest pain?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                No. Some people, especially women and people with diabetes, may have
                symptoms that are mild, different from “classic” chest pain or not obvious.
                Others may have no symptoms until a serious event occurs.

            <button class="faq-question">Can stress alone cause heart disease?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Long-term stress does not usually cause heart disease by itself, but it
                can raise blood pressure, affect cholesterol and encourage unhealthy habits.
                Together, these changes can increase your risk.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">If heart disease runs in my family, is it guaranteed I will get it?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                No. A family history raises your risk but does not guarantee you will
                develop heart disease. Healthy lifestyle choices and medical care can still
                greatly reduce your chances.
