          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            “Heart disease” is commonly used to describe several different problems with
            the heart and blood vessels. Many of these conditions are related to a process
            called atherosclerosis, where fatty deposits (plaque) build up inside the arteries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, this buildup can narrow or block blood flow to the heart muscle and
            other organs. When the heart does not get enough oxygen-rich blood, it can lead
            to chest pain, heart attack, heart failure or other serious complications.

        <h2>Common Types of Heart Disease</h2>
        <p class="section-summary">
          Different types of heart disease affect the heart in different ways. Many people may
          have more than one type at the same time.

            <h3>Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)</h3>
            <p>
              CAD happens when the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle become
              narrowed or blocked. It is a leading cause of chest pain (angina) and heart attacks.

            <h3>Heart Rhythm Problems (Arrhythmias)</h3>
            <p>
              Arrhythmias are abnormal heartbeats. The heart may beat too fast, too slow or
              in an irregular pattern. Some arrhythmias are harmless; others can be serious.

            <h3>Heart Failure</h3>
            <p>
              Heart failure means the heart is not pumping blood as well as it should. It does
              not mean the heart has stopped, but it may struggle to meet the body’s needs.

            <h3>Congenital Heart Disease</h3>
            <p>
              Congenital heart disease refers to heart problems present at birth. These may
              involve the heart’s walls, valves or blood vessels.

            <h3>Heart Valve Disease</h3>
            <p>
              Valve disease occurs when one or more of the heart’s valves do not open or
              close properly, affecting blood flow through the heart.

            <h3>Inflammatory Heart Conditions</h3>
            <p>
              Conditions like myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) or pericarditis (lining
              of the heart) are often caused by infections or immune system problems.

        <h2>How Heart Disease Develops</h2>
        <p>
          Many forms of heart disease are long-term (chronic) conditions that develop slowly.
          High blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity and lack of exercise
          can damage blood vessels and the heart over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This damage can lead to plaque buildup, stiffening of the arteries and changes in
          how the heart muscle works. Because this process is gradual, you may not notice
          symptoms at first. Regular checkups are important, especially if you have risk factors.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                No. Heart disease refers to a group of conditions that affect the heart and
                blood vessels. A heart attack is one possible emergency event that can occur
                when blood flow to part of the heart is blocked.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Yes. Many people have heart disease without obvious symptoms, especially
                early on. That is why routine checkups and risk factor screening are important.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Any heart condition should be taken seriously. However, the severity can
                vary widely. Some forms are mild and manageable, while others can be life-threatening
                if not treated. Your healthcare provider can explain your specific situation.
