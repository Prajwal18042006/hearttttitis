              <p>
                It is never too late to make heart-healthy changes. Even if you already
                have heart disease, healthy habits can slow progression and improve quality of life.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Many guidelines suggest at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity
                each week, but your provider may recommend a plan tailored to your health
                and abilities.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                No. Supplements should not replace prescribed medicines. Always talk to your
                provider before starting any supplement, as some may interact with medicines
                or not be appropriate for you.
