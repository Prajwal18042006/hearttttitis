          Dial your local emergency number (such as 911) if you or someone near you experiences:
        </p>
        <ul class="alert-list">
          <li>Chest pain, pressure or tightness that lasts more than a few minutes</li>
          <li>Pain that spreads to the arm, back, neck, jaw or stomach</li>
          <li>Shortness of breath, especially if sudden or severe</li>
          <li>Sudden weakness, fainting, heavy sweating or nausea</li>
          <li>Heart palpitations with dizziness or loss of consciousness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Do not drive yourself to the hospital. Emergency responders can begin treatment on the way and are trained to handle sudden complications.
